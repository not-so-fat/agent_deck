## Problem: Too many MCPs on my agent

<img src="./misc/CursorTooManyTools.png" alt="Cursor Too Many Tools" width="60%" />

People are using agent app like Cursor for many purposes, eventually they would have **many MCP servers** to provide different tools.
However agent app slows down, and becomes inaccurate with too many MCP servers.

On the other hand, when I use Cursor, there are different contexts (Coding, documentation, task management, just try new MCP services), I don't need to connect all the servers at once.


## Idea: Local MCP server manages context

<img src="./misc/Idea.png" alt="Frontend" width="90%" />

AgentDeck provides a local MCP server, which acts as a local context-aware MCP server. You can connect one endpoint for your agent (http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp), which connects to your favorite MCP servers, but only to ones fit on the context you choose.




## Features

### Frontend UI
<img src="./misc/UI.png" alt="Frontend" width="90%" />
1. Register as many MCP servers into your collections (Remote / Local)
    - If it requires OAuth authentication, follow the instruction on UI to configure it
2. Create "deck" as your context
3. Put / remove MCP servers into your deck
4. Choose one deck as "active" which is connected to agent 


### **MCP Server**
1. Configure your agent to connect MCP server at "http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp"
2. Asking query as usual, it can use services on active deck. It has 5 tools
    - get_decks
    - get_active_deck
    - list_active_deck_services
    - list_service_tools
    - call_service_tool



## Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 20.x LTS (required)
- npm or yarn

Note on Node version:
- If you use Homebrew, ensure Node 20 is first in PATH:
  - macOS (arm64): `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH"`
- If you use nvm, run: `nvm install 20 && nvm use 20`
- Native modules like `better-sqlite3` are built against the active Node; using Node 20 avoids NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatches.

### **Installation**
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd agent-deck
npm install
npm run build
```

### **Run Service**
```bash
# Start all services with one command (backend 8000, frontend 3000, MCP 3001)
npm run dev:all
```



## How It Works

1. **Register Services**: Add MCP servers to your collection (Remote or Local)
2. **Create Decks**: Organize services into context-specific decks
3. **Activate Deck**: Choose which deck your agent should use
4. **Connect Agent**: Point your agent to `http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp`
5. **Use Tools**: Your agent can now access tools from services in the active deck
